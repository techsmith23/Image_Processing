# Image_Processing

- This was a recent project that I did at The University Of Florida that focuses on reading in a different number of files in a binary format, processing the files
  within different ways, and being able to create new files that are of the same binary format
  
- This project was created using C++. This repo includes files of the source code, as well as descriptions of the project specifications
